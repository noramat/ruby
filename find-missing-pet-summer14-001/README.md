# Find the Missing Pet!

## Instructions

You just began your job as Web Developer at the Animal Sanctuary and they've got decent way for organizing photos of their favorite alumni animals, but unfortunately, something went wrong and most photos aren't in their right folders! It's your job to move through their directory structure and put the animals in their right place. The photos have been named really well, so figuring out their correct location shouldn't be too tricky.

Because you're a computer genius, you know the most efficient (and awesome) way is to navigate the directory on the command line. Use your bash command-line skills to get the photos in their correct folders!

As a refresher, here's a list of commands to help you with this task:

`pwd`: Print Working Directory shows you where you are

`cd ..`: change your current directory to the parent (one above it)

`ls`: list all files and directories

`mv`: move a file

Remember, it's always helpful to know where you are in your directory tree in relation to where you want to go. Keep that in mind as you write out your command-line paths!

## Checking Your Work

First, run `bundle install`. This is going to load the gems in the `Gemfile`.

From the `find-missing-pet` directory, just run `ruby test.rb` to check your progress! This file will also tell you the correct locations for the animals!

If everything prints green, you've successfully brought all the animals home!
